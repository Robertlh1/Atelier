## Introduction
This project was a 1 week sprint where I built a database to replace the external API used in my [Catwalk](https://github.com/Robertlh1/Catwalk) repo.

I was provided with 6GB of CSV files each with 1-2 million rows and reverse engineered the API routes as queries in PostgreSQL to return the same data in an identical nested structure so that no editing would be necessary on the website itself, then integrated the new database into the existing website.
